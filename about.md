Until I actually have any content worth mentioning posted here, let me quickly explain what I _intend_ this site to become:

A place for me to collect ideas, links and tools related to Dungeons & Dragons 5e.

I might expand that to other TTRPGs. I might use it to summarize other blogs I read on related topics.

A lot of the content being produced for people interested in this stuff is in video format. Don't get me wrong: The medium
is great, it's just... not how _my_ brain works. I want text. So I'll add text. So I'll weave all these youtube videos
and youtube shorts together into a tapestry here for you to dive into. And extract the core ideas I want to use for my own games.

I'd like this site, over time, to get at the core of how to tell dnd stories. How to build campaigns? Sessions? Villains? Puzzles?

I also intend to use AI as a co-creator of the content on this site. Take for example Aunt Griselda here: I could never draw that without
the help of ChatGPT. This has _some_ drawbacks, see for example the way she's holding her teacup. This only really works, because Aunt Griselda
is magic.
