# Diana - the godess of wrath
(Diana is a working title)

Base the lore and mythology of a godess on the story of "Dingos stole my Baby"
- locked up and shunned from the other gods
- finally being proved right
- fury! slightly mad.

I understand that this story is someones personal tradgedy, but the basic elements are really moving. So mine this some more for underlying concepts and remove all references to dingos.
