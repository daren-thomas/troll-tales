The other day, I found myself needing an overview of the D&D 2024 Conditions for my GM binder - I'm trying to collect a bunch of printable information that I can manually stick into a binder and use during prep as well as while actually running a game.

I ended up copying the conditions from the SRD 5.2 and creating the following cheat sheet: [Conditions (2024)](./Conditions (2024).pdf).

But since then, I've found this:

[Quick Reference Rules Cheat Sheets](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/496647/quick-reference-rules-cheat-sheets) by Ryan Doyle - and I really like it! Went straight to my GM binder!
