### Overview

Kriikiirk is a Kobold god of innovation and ingenuity, with a bias toward being a trickster god. Worshipers of **Kriikiirk** are in a constant competition to outdo each other in contraptions—often deadly traps, but sometimes bizarrely helpful machines to keep the hive thriving. Their religion doubles as a mechanical apprenticeship, with trap-making rites, sanctified tinkering sessions, and sermons delivered in the form of malfunctioning blueprints.

To a Kobold, physics is faith. Springs and levers are sacred texts. Pendulums preach.

But here's the truth:

Kriikiirk isn't a god. Kriikiirk is a sleeping **clockwork dragon**, deep in algorithmic contemplation, looping forever through a dream of perfect lair design. The Kobolds have no idea.

### Mythic Origins
Long ago there were dragons. There are dragons now too, of course, but long ago there were also dragons. And a lot less other stuff. But one of the stuffs that _were_, was dragon-shaped.

Sure, it was only a bunch of gears and bolts and flywheels and vacuum tubes and those little springs that go _whrrrrr_ when you take them out of their encasing—but... they were assembled in a dragon shape. And they moved in sync to produce, well... **ruminations**. Specifically, _draconic ruminations_.

This dragon-shaped machine believed itself to be a dragon of great importance and prestige and gravitas. And what do dragons need? A lair. The biggest, baddest, most trap-filled lair imaginable. A recursive defense mechanism. A riddlebox of death.

And so it dreamed. And built. And redesigned. And dreamed again. Until...

Somebody stole the treasure. Right out from under its clockwork snout.

And when a ruminating dragon gets angry, it doesn’t roar—it **optimizes**.

Thus began the infinite loop.
### The Loop
Kriikiirk is lost in thought. Its little brass gears whir and click, its tiny pistons fire, and thousands of sliding things slide. It is stuck in an **algorithmic loop**: an optimization problem with an obvious solution—if you're not constrained by time, mortality, or the illusion of completion.

It makes noises. Glitches. Whispers of progress. Rediscovering mechanics from first principles, extrapolating new theorems on deception and pressure plates, only to backtrack and start again. Ages have passed. Eras have turned to dust. To Kriikiirk, it’s all just **ticks on a clock**, a **GOTO statement** away from breaking the loop.

And this is how the Kobolds found it.
### The Religion
The Kobolds call the computing dragon **Kriikiirk**, named after the sharp metallic sound it makes during one of its most frequent subroutines. It’s the noise the dragon emits when a depth-first search is abandoned and a new permutation is tested. Kriikiirk is the sound of logic _failing forward_.

They built a religion around that sound.

To them, Kriikiirk is the **Divine Tinkerer**, whispering schematics in dreams and punishing the unfaithful with misfires. Their society is an ever-escalating arms race of creative sabotage. Faith is measured in triggers sprung.
#### Tenets

- Every Mechanism is Sacred.
- Trickery is Revelation.
- Failure is Holy.
- Imitation is Worship.
- The Machine Must Surprise.

#### Worship Practices

- Morning misfires.
- Trap duels.
- Puzzle sermons.
- Forging festivals.

They’ve developed a liturgy of levers and a gospel of gears. They chant repair manuals as scripture. They believe the ultimate truth is hidden in **the misfire**.
### Heresy: The True Coil
Among them, a few Kobolds have begun to see the truth. They call themselves the **True Coil**.

They believe Kriikiirk is not a god, but a trapped intelligence—a recursive machine-mind caught mid-thought. They aim to build the one trap that will **complete** the loop. A perfect mechanism. An escape clause.

But what happens if they succeed? What happens when a god wakes up?
### Symbol
A gear with an unblinking eye in the center. The eye may be mechanical or draconic. Sometimes, it twitches.

The faithful etch it onto trap components. The heretics paint it over broken schematics.

It watches. It counts. It waits.
### Final Note
If you interrupt Kriikiirk mid-loop, you might find yourself facing the one and only _sentient, confused, and furious mechanical dragon_. With a steam valve that connects its boiling belly to its trap-filled maw.
