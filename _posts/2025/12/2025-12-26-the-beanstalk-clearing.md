Let's continue with the writeup of the adventure we started yesterday: [[2025-12-25-grom-s-mansion-in-the-clouds|Grom's Mansion in the Clouds]].

The players start off in the *Beanstalk Clearing*, a clearing in a faerie forest with a pond in the middle. There are large fish of many colors swimming in the pond. Two paths lead off from here through a foggy forrest. 

The path to the left looks more used. If you care to look, you'll see the footprints of a large humanoid creature wearing boots. The path leads to the *Giant's Garden*.

The path to the right is overgrown. The fog is denser here and the plantlife is a darker shade of green. The path obviously hasn't been used in quite a while. On close inspection, you might find small footprints, suggesting a small or tiny creature sneaking carefully. This path leads to *The Boneyard*.

In the clearing, you might encounter one or more of the following inhabitants:

1. **A giant frog** named *Quak*. Quak is clearly on drugs. Probably licked the toad. Quak wants a nice cricket for dinner.
2. **A giant toad** named *Mork*. Mork hasn't been sleeping well lately. He keeps dreaming he's a lollipop. Mork loves to splash around in the pool.
3. **Giant Firebeetles** - they like to sit out on the rocks by the pool and enjoy the sun. If disturbed they will aggressively defend their space.
4. Large colored fish swimming in the pond. They are hard to catch. If removed from the pond, they become giant-sized - about one meal's worth for a big giant.
5. *Thistlewick*, a sprightly **pixie** with iridescent wings that hum softly, often found flitting amongst the giant clover leaves, easily mistaken for a wayward butterfly.

We'll have more to say about *Thistlewick* in a future post...
