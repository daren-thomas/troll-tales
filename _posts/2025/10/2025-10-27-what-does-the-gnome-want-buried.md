title: What does the gnome want buried?
---
This table is based on a quest I rolled on the 5e Artisanal Database, available to patreons of [Sly Flourish](https://slyflourish.com/). The quest went something like this:

> **Averil Gooseseeker**, a pious gnome hermit, wants the characters to bury a secret at a draconic holy crag inhabited by giants.

What's the secret?

1. A cursed locket containing a locke of hair of a Manticore.
2. A tome of evil spells that whisper in the dark.
3. Secrets that have manifested as little walnuts that rattle when nobody is looking.
4. The talking head of his late brother.
5. One small emerald green bean.
6. An urn containing the remains of his late mother in law.
7. A salami sandwich.
8. A bone engraved in draconic. It looks like it might be from a human.
9. A rumor made material by a witch.
10. The moon, caught in a reflection in a teacup.

Only thing left to answer now is: Why is it a secret?
