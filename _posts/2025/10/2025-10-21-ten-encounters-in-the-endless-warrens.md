title: Ten Encounters in the Endless Warrens
---
1. A hot-dog stand, run by a kobold called Frank. The hot-dogs taste great!
2. A sad lump of goo that is dreaming of becoming a proper gelatinous cube some day.
3. Parakeets. Lots of them. With bloody beaks.
4. A big fat Ogre with a baked goods fetish called Yo-Mama!
5. Sunflower seeds in front of a locked door.
6. Spider husks but no other signs of arachnids.
7. The tiniest little wizard tower you can imagine!
8. An old crone got lost looking for mushrooms.
9. Jarl, a love-crazed swashbuckler in denial.
10. Who let the dogs out? They look stinky and happy and friendly. Too bad they have tentacles for tails...
