title: Random Goblin Shit
---
1. Super stinky feet.
2. Jittery, a bit like a meth head.
3. Wooden teeth, painted red. Insecure about his dentures.
4. A very fine Waistcoat with a watch on a chain. Where did he acquire such attire?
5. A cake in a cake box.
6. Weasels in a bag. They're squirming. The goblin pretends not to notice.
7. Wears glasses, they're cracked and obviously the wrong prescription.
8. Teeth filed to points.
9. No shirt, covered in tatoos, all pumped up and roided out. The others are hyping him up.
10. Rabid with froth at his mouth.
