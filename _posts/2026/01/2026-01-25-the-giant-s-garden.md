title: The Giant's Garden
---
Grom is a gardener! He has a big garden, where he grows many different kinds of vegetables, fruits and herbs. These are all giant-sized, so imagine a garden full of giant pumpkin, zucchini, cabbages and tomatoes. Big, fist-sized blueberries grow on huge bushes.

In between the giant flora, there are, of course, normal-sized plants and all the little critters that belong in a garden: Bees, worms, snails, snakes and mice. They have all found a place to live in the garden.

The garden smells earthy and fresh. You can hear the bees buzzing and birds chirping.

There is a huge bucket in one corner.

A Giant Goat called Gruff lives in the garden, tied to a big fat post. The goat is smarter than an average goat - and meaner. He'll also make a lot of noise if agitated, bleating until someone (Grom) comes to check up on him.

This is where *Tilly Thistlewick* lives. She's made peace with the goat - and brings it treats. Gruff loves the blueberries above all other treats.

The garden is connected to the [[2025-12-26-the-beanstalk-clearing|Beanstalk Clearing]] and the Stone Circle.
