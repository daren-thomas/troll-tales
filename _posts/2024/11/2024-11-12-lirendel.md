Lirendel is an **elven city** built high in the branches of an ancient grove of **Sequoia trees**. The architecture blends living wood and crystal, which glow softly to illuminate the platforms and bridges shaped by elven magic. Silver ivy forms pathways between homes nestled in the branches, with hanging gardens blooming year-round.

Scholars and druids gather in the **Luminous Library**, where knowledge is stored in the leaves of the trees. At the city's heart stands **Ithilgalad**, an ancient tree where ceremonies and council meetings take place.

Though serene, Lirendel is well-defended by shifting branches and vigilant sentinels. A corps of archers known as the **Lirendel Archers** watch from hidden vantage points, always ready to protect the grove.

## Government 

Lirendel is governed by a Counsel of three elves:
- **Ilanis Na誰lo** - female, stern, _ancient_, responsible for managing the wisdom collected in the Ithilgalad
- **Peren Ostoroth** - male, middle aged, hot headed, responsible for the defences of the city
- **Mya** - female child, responsible for the future of elven-kind and contact to the other races

Contrary to expectations many visitors to Lirendel have, Mya is actually the most powerful of the council. This is because the Elves realised long ago that their longevity can lead to getting stuck in their ways of thinking and young Elves are tasked with making sure the Government can respond to new situations appropriately, with the elder members of the council advising. **Peren** secretly would like to have more control, though.

The main government building is structured around the **Ithilgalad**, the oldest and tallest of the Sequoia trees in the middle of Lirendel. The Ithilgalad houses the **Council Court** and the **Library**. It is heavily guarded, though *citizens* of Lirendel can pass in and out freely.
## Underground

Not all inhabitants of Lirendel are considered _citizens_ and thus allowed free access to the knowledge stored in the Ithilgalad. Only Elves are given this status. Half-Elves, ambassadors from other races and especially the large community of **Forest Gnomes** tasked with maintenance and other menial work are considered second-class and have less rights in Lirendel Society.

The Forrest Gnomes have an underground organization, called simply the **Union**. Getting into contact with the Union can be tricky business as they're not strictly a legal institution. Some senior members can be found in **The Burrow**, a pub mainly frequented by Gnomes and other lower-class folk in the poorer parts of Lirendel - in the roots of the Sequoias.

**Greta Waldmut** is the leader of the Union. She is an elderly matron. She isn't planning a revolution. Just... recognition for the work done by the forest gnomes in Lirendel.

## Altars

At the root of the Ithilgalad, there is an entrance to a **grotto**. Inside the grotto is a deep pond that connects Lirendel to the spirit of **Sehanine Moonbow**. The grotto serves as a sacred space for elves of Lirendel to connect with their **goddess of the moon, dreams, and mysteries**. At the edge of the pond is a beautiful, natural altar where offerings are left during times of reflection, change, and celestial events.
## Resources

The main resource in Lirendel is the **Luminous Library** - the wealth of knowledge stored in the leaves of ancient Sequoia trees. Most of the Elves in Lirendel are connected to this library in some way.

The knowledge stored in the Library is not given freely. Instead, **the Elves trade knowledge for resources**, especially materials and products hard to obtain in the forest.

The clerics in the sacred grotto can extract **Elixirs of Health** by combining Moonlight and Sap from the Redwood trees. The Elves feel duty bound to help restore creatures to health that are brought to the grotto - as long as a **pact of non-violence** is kept.
## Defences

The **Lirendel Archers** are famous for their skills with the Elven Longbow. The corps is 100 men strong and they use the Elvish Veteran Archer stats from the Tome of Beasts:

```statblock
creature: Elvish Veteran Archer
```

The **Mists of Memory** makes it very hard (DC 15 INT) for creatures to enter the city without becoming confused and turning back unless guided through. There is an official gate to Lirendel just outside the mists where visitors can request a visa and entry to the city. 

## Social

The elves love to socialise, especially under the light of the moon. These revels include laughter, merriment, music and lightly intoxicating sequoia sap brews.

The other races, except for important guests, are often in the background of these parties. Instead, they tend to congregate in pubs located among the roots of the sequoias, for example the **Burrow**, a pub serving ale and mushroom stew frequented by forest gnomes, including the **Union**, an egalitarian organisation working for the rights of non-elves in Lirendel.

A speciality in Lirendel is their flat bread, a bit like Naan, but light as a feather and spicy, tasting a bit like a combination of cinnamon and maple sirup.

## Important Landmarks in Lirendel

**Ithilgalad**: The central and most sacred tree of Lirendel, the Ithilgalad serves as the heart of the city. It is where important ceremonies are held, council meetings take place, and the city's history is recorded.

**Luminous Libraries**: Located high in the branches, these libraries are unique as they store knowledge in the leaves of the trees themselves. The largest of these libraries is located in the **Ithilgalad** itself,  containing the most valuable and ancient knowledge. Scholars and druids gather here to learn and meditate. The leaves can be read by those attuned to the magic, revealing words and symbols that shift with thought, while writing is done through whispered incantations that imprint knowledge onto the foliage.

**The Hanging Gardens**: A series of gardens suspended along the platforms and bridges, blooming with flowers that change throughout the year. These gardens are a symbol of the elves' harmony with nature and provide herbs and ingredients for both culinary and medicinal purposes.

**Lirendel Archer Outposts**: Hidden along the edges of the city, these outposts are where the Lirendel Archers keep watch. Built seamlessly into the trees, they serve as both lookout points and places of rest for the archers.

**The Crystal Paths**: Bridges and walkways made of living wood intertwined with crystal, these paths glow softly at night, providing light and guiding residents through the city. They are a testament to the craftsmanship of Lirendel's artisans.

**The Mists of Memory**: Surrounding Lirendel, the Mists affect anyone trying to get into the city without permission by wiping their short term memory, leaving them confused and disoriented. Anyone entering the mists that fails a DC 15 INT saving throw will be affected by the mists and get lost in the forest, eventually ending up outside the mists again, but at a random place. There is a Gate in the forest along the road to Lirendel guarded by Lirendel Archers that travellers wishing to enter the city must pass through and where they can obtain a guide through the mists.

**The Grotto**: At the root of the Ithilgalad, there is an entrance to a **grotto**. Inside the grotto is a deep pond that connects Lirendel to the spirit of **Sehanine Moonbow**. This is tended by priestesses that perform rites and help heal creatures brought to the grotto. They also produce **Elixirs of Health** using the unique magic of the grotto and its connection to the godess **Sehanine**.
