Just watched the following video on youtube: [D&D Exploration SUCKS. This is why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd2svbU7t50).

It suggests to always add some _movement_ in scene descriptions.

We've all heard of incorporating all the senses, but actually having motion being called out is something I'm totally going to give a try!
