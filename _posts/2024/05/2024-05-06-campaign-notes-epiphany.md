I was just doing my nails, getting ready for bed when I had a small epiphany:

> Campaign notes don't have to be perfect

In fact, they don't even have to match: I have an analog notebook for random ideas
that I sometimes carry around and even less often scribble into. I also have an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
vault for keeping notes on campaigns I'm running and campaigns I'm playing in.

And I fret. I worry. I fear inconsistencies.

The epiphany I just had: It doesn't really matter. There is only one SPOT (Single Point Of Truth):
What happens at the table. Everything else doesn't exist yet, or stopped existing the moment it
became part of the live game. All the writing, even the stuff on this site - _especially_ the stuff
on this site, is just ephemeral (note to self: look up the exact meaning of ephemeral) to a
dnd session and it's ok to be messy, to be sloppy, to be, _*gasp*_ inconsistent.

I spend _way_ too much time thinking about organization and restructuring.

You know what truly creative people do? They _create_. They don't catalogue or organize or collect. Not _a priori_.
Not before there's anything worth collecting. And it gets messy. And that's beautiful in it's own right.

I will learn to live with the mess.
