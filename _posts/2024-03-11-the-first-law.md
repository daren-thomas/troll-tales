Let's kick off this site with some ideas based on Joe Abercrombies series of books starting with
The First Law. And no, this isn't going to be a book club. Instead, I'm going to try and extract
some cool ideas from the books that might end up in a dnd campaign.

First of, how cool are the Northmen? Here are some things we can jot down about them:

- Carleon - a main city, where a centralization and consolidation of power is happening
- Carls & Thralls - a socially stratified system
- Named Men - so many flavor here
- A famous hall with a throne named after a long dead hero from a time of legend
- "back to the mud" - a simple yet solid belief system and way of looking at the world
- The High Places - fantastic location (TODO: link to sly flourish)
- Flatheads, encroaching upon the realms of men (mystery: where did they come from?)
- The wild men from beyond the Crinna (Half-Giants?)
- A society of warlords and farmers and fishermen
- Steel - there's something about steel that just, you know, steels
- The Circle - shield wall duels
- Witches & The Long Eye
